  The uncanny valley is a phenomenon where characters which are either
  possessing human characteristics or not being lifelike appear creepy or
  unnerving. In hollywood animation it's the difference between Merida in Brave
  and young Finn in Tron. And in robotics it's the difference between the
  cuteness of R2D2 and this monstrosity (an android with silicon face). In order
  to survive in modern society we've learnt to read subtle flashes of emotion on
  the human face in order to empathise with the people we're interacting with
  (lie to me). We know intrinsically when someone is lying, we can sense when
  someone is ill or pregnant, often before they know themselves. So, when a
  celebrity gets their new facelift and changes the way the muscles move and
  deforms their
  facialfeatureswedon'ttrustthem,howcanweknowwhenthey'retrulyhappyif
  theywearapermanent smile? This is the secret behind the uncanny valley, if
  something looks or behaves almost human but not quite enough then we feel
  disgust, anger and fear ­ these people or characters appear deep inside the
  uncanny valley. However, if an inanimate object is imbued with humanistic
  traits we adore them. Remember the companion cube in portal 2? It's literally
  just a box, but when imbued with a personality we grow an affection for it
  (pixar lamp), similar to how we love our pets and invent entire lives for them
  because we recognise ourselves in their actions and we assign them a
  personality.
